# ocr2keepers Oracle Plugin
Initialize the plugin by creating a new Delegate

```

## Unit Testing
Unit testing is used extensively and the primary goal is to keep test coverage above 70%.

Test coverage should be rerun with every commit either by running a git hook or `make coverage`.

It is recommended that you install the git hooks so that the automated tooling is part of your workflow. Simply run:

```
cp -r .githooks/ .git/hooks
```

Explore test coverage per file with
```
$ go tool cover -html=cover.out
```

## Benchmarking
Benchmarking helps identify general function inefficiencies both with memory and processor time. Only benchmark functions that are likely to run multiple times, asynchronously, or be processor/memory intensive.

Using benchmarking consistently requires that os, arch, and cpu be kept consistent. Do not overwrite the `benchmark.txt` file unless your specs are identical.

To run benchmarking:
```
$ make benchmark | new.txt
```

To view a diff in benchmarks:
```
$ go install golang.org/x/perf/cmd/benchstat@latest
$ benchstat benchmarks.txt new.txt
```
